# Sprint 3 - Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation

# Data Preparation Phase 
## 3.1 Task: Select Data
### Rationale for Inclusion/Exclusion: 
→ Columns that did not have relevance to the analysis were dropped (**Developer Email, Privacy Policy, and Developer Website**)

→ Columns with extra information like Developer contact info is extra data that could be removed

→ Columns with numeric values and columns that provided insights into potential app KPIs were kept in the analysis in order to explore further how to evaluate app performance (**Price, Rating, Rating Count, etc.**)

→ Even though there are many features remaining, we wanted to keep a substantial number of features in order to have enough variables to construct meaningful dashboards
