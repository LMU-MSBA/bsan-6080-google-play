# Sprint 1 - Business Understanding
## 1.1 Task: Determine Business Objectives
### Background: 

Our mission is connecting the right third-party app and game developers with the right opportunities at the right time.  We will be part of the Google Play Partnerships team, focused on helping strategic Google partners have successful businesses using Google Play and the Android platform.  Google Play Store makes money from in-app purchases, cost to download the app, and advertising within the play store.  


### Objectives: 
 1. Determinants of install 
 2. Number of installs vs. ratings
 3. Under performing apps
 4. App Categories
 5. Who is performing well and what do they have in common? Who isn’t performing well and why do they underperform?

### Business Success Criteria: 

→ Data pipeline that connects cleaned data to our business intelligence visualization and modeling tools

→ Tableau dashboard for high level view of the KPIs

→ Python Model to provide recommendations to key stakeholders based on historical data


## 1.2 Task: Assess Situation
### Inventory of Resources: 
→ Greg Lontok 

→ Gautham (author of Kaggle dataset)

→ Tableau, Python, Trello, Project Management 

→ Fellow group members  

→ Google Play Store and Google

→ Other faculty and coding reference materials for Machine Learning and Text Analysis
 

### Requirements, Assumptions, & Constraints:
→ List sprints and what is due 

→ Assuming correct and error-free data was pulled by Gautham 

→ Assuming Google Play monotizes on installs and in-app purchases 

→ Availability of resources

→ Lack of transparency in some columns (ex: in-app purchases is boolean) 

→ Review text is not included in the dataset, so we must scrape the text ourselves

→ Lack of transparency on full funnel (we are only seeing the middle of the funnel like inventory data and user in app purchase data is not available)


### Risks & Contingencies: 

→ Risk: Falling behind on the sprints 

    → Contingency: We must maintain our schedule and let our team members know if we are falling behind on something
  
→ Risk: Might have to find a new data set

    → Contingency: If we feel that we are missing data or certain variable we need for analysis, we may need to look for additional data sources


### Terminology: 
→ Description of each of the columns

→ Digital marketing and app field

→ Acquisition = installs

→ Data mining

→ Sentiment analysis 

→ Ratings (goes back to description of the columns)

→ Understanding of the terminology used in the data


### Costs & Benefits: 
→ Time 

→ Insights gleaned 

→ Benefit to Google because it gives factual and data-driven insights that can help the play store better understand developer needs

→ Benefit to developers 

→ Benefit to the people

→ Benefit to us in workforce (experience)

## 1.3 Task: Determine Data Mining Goals
### Data Mining Goals: 

→ Mine data that allows us to analyze app reviews through text analytics 

→ Find data that would supplement our original dataset in order to run machine learning models

    → Possible ML:  kNN (Recommendation model) 

 

### Data Mining Success Criteria: 

→ Demonstrating we can create an accurate and provide a recommendation or prediction that would supplement our original analysis, using the data we mined

→ Successfully run some type of sentiment analysis on review data mined from the Google Play Store


## 1.4 Task: Produce Project Plan

### Project Plan: 
→ Regular team meetings to collaborate on items that need team input and attribute tasks to each team member 

→ Follow given sprint schedule 

→ Acknowledge and keep in mind our risks and contingencies

→ Set group deadlines before actual deadlines

→ Prioritize using the Fibonacci Scale

→ Utilize Microsoft Teams for coordinating

### Initial Assessment of Tools & Techniques:

→ Tableau: Used for creating dashboards and analyzing KPIs

→ Python:  Used to clean and manipulate/organize the data

→ Machine Learning Models:  Used to do in depth predictive and recommendation analyses

→ Text Analysis:  Used to analyze review data to come to a conclusion regarding customer sentiment

→ Trello:  Used to organize the group and manage project goals/tasks

→ Microsoft Teams:  Used to communicate with the group

→ Excel:  Platform used for storing the CSV with our data

→ Scrum:  Used for organizing team goals and deadlines

→ CRISP-DM: Used for project management
