1.1 Task: Determine Business Objectives
Background: 

Our mission is connecting the right third-party app and game developers with the right opportunities at the right time.  We will be part of the Google Play Partnerships team, focused on helping strategic Google partners have successful businesses using Google Play and the Android platform.  Google Play Store makes money from in-app purchases, cost to download the app, and advertising within the play store.  

What Google considers as a top performing app: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859173?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmetrics


Objectives: 
Determinants of install 
Number of installs vs. ratings
Under performing apps
App Categories
Who is performing well and what do they have in common? Who isn’t performing well and why do they SUCK?

Business Success Criteria: 
→ Data pipeline that connects cleaned data to our business intelligence visualization and modeling tools
→ Tableau dashboard for high level view of the KPIs
→ Python Model (type?) to provide recommendations to key stakeholders based on historical data


You will provide business insights to our key stakeholders (e.g., Vice Presidents, Directors, Partner Managers) on the Google Play Partnerships team to enable them to run the global Google Play business. You will partner with Operations and Developer Marketing teams to enable scaled means of improving third-party apps and games. We will work with the Product Managers to improve Google Play products (i.e., Google Play Store and Google Play Console) to make them better suited to the needs of strategically important app and game developers.








1.2 Task: Assess Situation
Inventory of Resources: 
→ Greg Lontok 
→ Gautham (author of Kaggle dataset)
→ Tableau, Python, Trello, Project Management 
→ Fellow group members  
→ Google Play Store and Google 

Requirements, Assumptions, & Constraints:
→ List sprints and what is due 

→ Assuming correct and error-free data was pulled by Gautham 
→ Assuming Google Play monopolizes on installs and in-app purchases 

→Availability of resources
→ Lack of transparency in some columns (in-app purchases is boolean) 
→ Review text is not included in the dataset, so we must scrape the text ourselves
→ Lack of transparency on full funnel (we are only seeing the middle of the funnel → inventory data and user in app purchase data is not available)


Risks & Contingencies: 
Will Megan single-handedly take down google??
Falling behind on the sprints 
Might have to find a new data set 



Terminology:

Benefit to developers
Benefit to the people
